Spring Boot Data JPA by default supports connecting with One Database 
Database connection Configuration (AutoConfigured) is given by Spring Boot only.

We need to pass inputs using either properties (or) yml
Like: driver class url username password  show-sql dialect ddl-auto ..etc

=> This time i want to to multiple databases.
=> We need to define below objects(Beans) in order:
  a. DataSource
  b. EntityManagerFactory
  c. TransactionManager

  by using Spring Java Configuration Style:
@Configuration
public class ____ {
  //no.of methods = no.of objects
  @Bean
  public <class/interface> <objName>(){
  
  }
}
